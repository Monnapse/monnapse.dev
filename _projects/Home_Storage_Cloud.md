This project was really cool, its an online cloud storage I made for my home network. I can 
save, download, delete, and rename files from any computer that is connected to the network. Also there are 2 login page to access the cloud, to access the cloud you first need to enter the master password(this password is always the same for everyone) which I would share with everyone, then the second page you would enter your username and then a 2FA code. I use a raspberry pi with 2 external hard drives to store everything. I wanted to store my raspberry pi with my drives and not be messy so I decided to design a 3D printed case for it so I can have my raspberry pi plus my 2 drives in one case.
